# AIML232 - Assignment 2

A collection of machine learning experiments completed as a part of **AIML232** (2025) course projects.

- A2.2: Explore Central Limit Theorem with a given non-normal distribution.
- A2.3: Explore a made-up multivariate Gaussian distribution -- correlations between its variables, Mahalanobis distance of data points, and outlier detection.
- A2.4: Explore variations of a neural network using different hyperparameter settings (the data loading, different settings, and train_classifier function are given by the University)
